        <p>This site tells the story of professional hockey over the years 1909 to 2011 using data from
          <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/open-source-sports/professional-hockey-database" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kaggle's Professional Hockey Database</a>,
          a collection of historical statistics from men's professional hockey teams in North America. The dataset also includes information about each team to take the ice, each coach behind the bench, and each award to be offered, but we decided to
          focus on the player-level data and ask questions about the history of scoring in
          professional hockey. </p>
        <p> Specifically, our goal was to look at how scoring rates - by which we mean to say how many goals, assists, and points (points = goals + assists) have been tallied each year - have changed over time, what the scoring profiles of those
          considered to be the best to ever play look like, and what areas of the world produce the most prolific scorers. </p>
        <p>The first chart is a timeline describing the changes in both scoring totals and per-game rates throughout the history of professional hockey, as well as links to the events that incited those changes.</p>
        <p>The second section features profiles of players widely thought to be the best to ever play hockey. Explore their key stats, investigate their scoring rates season-by-season, and watch their highlights.</p>
        <p>The final section explores areas of the world that have produced professional players and how many points those players have produced. </p>

        <p>What are some common themes among the best players? </p>
        <p>How do the great defensemen differ from the great forwards and vice versa?</p>
        <p>Limitation: Note that, for example, Ovechkin's key stats chart looks much less impressive than Gretzky's and Orr's. Why? One of the main limitations to the dataset was the fact that it only contains stats up until 2011, so there are 8
          dominant seasons
          from Ovechkin that aren't reflected here. There's no doubt among the hockey community that Ovi is one of the best to ever play, but the dataset doesn't tell his whole story.</p>
        <p>Another limitation can be seen in Jacques Plante's key stats chart - notice that save percentage is not included. The dataset did not include a data for saves for Plante, who played from '52-'72. Though this dataset may not show it, Plante
          was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players by the NHL in 2017.</p>

        <p><b>NOTE</b>: areas colored grey have yet to produce a professional hockey player.</p>
        <p>Notice that there are many countries that have yet to produce a professional player. It's less a limitation of the dataset than it is a limitation of hockey, as the game is not as widespread as a sport like soccer. As a result, there's a
          lot of grey on the map, and that's just part of hockey's story; there's still a ton of room to grow.</p>

        <h1 class="panel__headline">Conclusion</h1>
        <p>So what did we learn?</p>
        <p>Scoring in the NHL, in terms of season totals, was largely driven by expansion. As teams joined the league, more goals and assists were tallied as there were many more players to do so. Lockouts also affected the totals, as disputes
          between players and the league shortened and even cancelled seasons.</p>
        <p>In terms of per-game scoring, rule changes were key. When the center red line was introduced in 1943, as the article linked noted, breakaways became a common method of
          scoring, and overall scoring soared across the league. This rule change is considered to be the beginning of the modern era in professional hockey. Teams then learned how to defend these plays, and scoring slowed in years after. </p>
        <p>The best players in hockey's history not only scored prolifically in terms of both totals and rates. They were able to string together several consecutive seasons of high-rate scoring that earned them awards, championships, and household
          recognition. The best goalies did the opposite; they prevented forwards from scoring an incredible percentage of the time and did so on a consistent basis.</p>
        <p>There are still many countries who still have the opportunite to produce their first professional hockey player. Among those that have, though, Canada is clearly the king, with the USA on its tail. Scandinavia and Russia have also produced
          many prolific scorers.</p>
        <p>Ontario and Quebec lead the way in terms of producing professional hockey players that score at a high rate; Minnesota and Michigan are the only US states to even come remotely close. Nunavut is the only Canadian territory yet to produce a
          player, while several US states, most in the Southeast, have not seen their first.</p>
        <p>If we had time, it would be fun to do a deep dive on how post-season stats differ from regular season stats. Also, it would be interesting to view the data on a team
          by team basis to see what sort of stats were key for indivudal team success.
